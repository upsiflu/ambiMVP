/*
 general approach:
 
 Per item, the renderer renders, as a list,
 (a) an .anchor (a button) to target the item.
   (+) perhaps .targeted
 (i) perhaps an item   (e.g. p, span, img, figure...) to present the item
     (select with .anchor+*)
 (t) perhaps a trail;
     this trail may be a container of children, or just the children,
     or an incipit for the list of children.
 
 In order to maintain a high level of isomorphy between
  -  editing in a list shape
  -  editing in the final layout
  -  viewing the final layout,
 we offload the layout completely to css and just render everything
 and hope that browsers don't waste time with those hidden nodes.
 
 
 states:
 
 (0) The basic style is visiting.
    (a) .anchors are hidden (but they are there, hovering
         on the top left corner of each item, via z-index)
    (i) items are unchanged
    (t) trails are unchanged
 (1) .editing
    (a) .anchors are shown
    (i) items are unchanged
    (t) trails are unchanged
 (2) .listing
    (a) .anchors are 100% wide; to form a list.
    (i) items are truncated to fully slide under the .anchor
    (t) trails:
        containers behave as before, except they are margined downwards so
        that their children are never obscured by an anchor.
